IACTA Pharmaceuticals is an innovative ophthalmic company developing a portfolio of novel assets in large ocular markets, beginning with ocular pain and dry eye disease. Due to an emerging gap between small research firms and large pharmaceutical companies, research ideas with great potential have limited opportunities for development. IACTA is filling this gap to accelerate innovation, address unmet need, and advance the eye care industry. IACTA’s leadership brings extensive experience with a history of success in ophthalmology, R&D execution, and pharmaceutical startups. Our team is dedicated to bringing the best ophthalmic innovations to market. We identify ground-breaking technologies that will make a difference in patients’ lives and launch them into effective eye care products.
